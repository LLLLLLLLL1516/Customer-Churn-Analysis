# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Goal of this project is to apply data science techniques to understand customer churn behaviors and build a predictive model to predict the probablity of future customer churn. 
# Background:
Churn is a key driver of EBITDA margin and an industry-wide challenge. A churned customer provides less revenue or zero revenue and icnreases competitor market share. It costs up to 5 times as much for an service provider to acquire a new subscriber as to retian an exising one. 
With the help of data science, companies are able to get business understanding of customer churn, develope and implement predictive model to predict future customer churn probability, then engage and act based on the result of analysis.
